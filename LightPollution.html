<p>Light pollution is the presence of unwanted, inappropriate, or excessive artificial lighting.[1] In a descriptive sense light pollution refers to any poorly implemented lighting, during the day or night, and can be found as an issue throughout the levels of our societies. Impacting all the way from the individual level, such as from an unwanted blinking light on a consumer product, to a community level, like a new urban development impacting existing communities from poorly planned street lights. Light pollution can also be understood as a phenomenon that refers not only to a specific source of pollution, but to the wider collective impact of intersecting sources of pollution.</p>
<p>Although this type of pollution can exist throughout the day, its effects are magnified during the night with the contrast of darkness. It has been estimated that 83 percent of the world's people live under light-polluted skies and that 23 percent of the world's land area is affected by skyglow.[3][4] The area affected by artificial illumination continues to increase.[5] As a major side-effect of urbanization, light pollution is blamed for compromising health, disrupting ecosystems, and spoiling aesthetic environments</p>
