<p>Thermal pollution is any deviation from the natural temperature in a habitat and can range from elevated temperatures associated with industrial cooling activities to discharges of cold water into streams below large impoundments.</p>

<p>The single biggest cause of thermal pollution is probably cooling for industrial machinery and power plants. Water is an excellent, and free, cooling agent. ... Water on hot paved surfaces gets hot, then runs off into nearby bodies of water, raising the water temperature.</p>
